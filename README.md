# Coursera-Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Prj
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate my ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set.

The R script, run_analysis.R does the following:

1. Downloads required files if they do not exist.
2. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
3. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
4. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
5. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
6. From the data set in step 4, I create a second, independent tidy data set entitled "tidy_data.txt", with the
   average of each variable for each SubjectID and Activity.
